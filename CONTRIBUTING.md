# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Regardless of your skill level, there are always ways to contribute.

## Bug Report

If you notice a bug, or have a feature request, please first search our issue tracker and see if there are any related issues. If the issue was previously reported, you should reply to the thread instead of opening a new issue so that it is easier for others to search and comment.

You should illustrate your problem with a [minimal reproducble example (reprex)](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) whenever applicable.

## Pull Request (PR)

If you want to contribute a feature or bug fix, you can fork our repo and submit a pull request. But before you make a substantial pull request, you should file an issue first and make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem.

You are advised to use a separate branch for each issue.

If the code is Python, it should follow the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). For shell scripts, please make sure it passes [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/).

Though not required, commit messages are recommended to follow the [Conventional Commits convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
