# Code of Conduct

The heart of all software is people. We want a productive, happy and agile community that can welcome new ideas in a complex field, improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between groups with very different needs, interests and skills.

As such, we have adopted this code of conduct and require all those who participate to agree and adhere to this Code in order to help us create a safe community experience for all. All people should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of any dimension of diversity, not limited to background, gender identity, ethnicity, religion or geographic location.

Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work. We acknowledge we come from a diverse background, and would gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. These guidelines exist to enable diverse individuals and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual advantage. This document outlines both expected and prohibited behavior.

## When to Use These Guidelines

These guidelines outline our behavior expectations as members of the community. Everyone who participates in activities related to this project is required to conform to this Code of Conduct.

## Expected Behaviors

The following behaviors are expected:

### Be respectful

Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic fashion. We don’t allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

### Be considerate

Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we should consider them when making decisions.

### Be direct but professional

We are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, respectfully.

### Be inclusive

Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.

### Understand different perspectives

Our goal should not be to "win" every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. "Winning" is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.

### Be collaborative

Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. Wherever possible, we work closely with upstream projects and others in the free software community to coordinate our efforts. We prefer to work transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.

### Take responsibility for our words and our actions

We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and work to right the wrong.

### Value decisiveness, clarity and consensus

Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them to persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction. We expect participants in the project to resolve disagreements constructively. When they cannot, we escalate the matter to structures with designated leaders to arbitrate and provide clarity and direction.

### Ask for help when unsure

Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.

### Step down considerately

When somebody leaves or disengages from the project, we ask that they do so in a way that minimises disruption to the project. They should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.

### Lead by example

Leadership can be exercised by anyone simply by taking action, there is no need to wait for recognition when the opportunity to lead presents itself. By matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Hold yourself and others accountable for behaviors.

## Behaviors That Will Not Be Tolerated

The following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable.

### Violence and threats of violence

Violence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxxing") online.

### Personal attacks

Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.

### Derogatory language

Hurtful or harmful language related to any dimension of diversity, not limited to background, gender identity, ethnicity, religion or geographic location, is not acceptable. If you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behavior in question.

### Disruptive behavior

Sustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated. This includes but not limited to influencing crowd actions that cause hostility in the session, and "talking over" speakers.

### Influencing unacceptable behavior

We will treat influencing or leading such activities the same way we treat the activities themselves, and thus the same consequences apply.

## Reporting

The project is initiated with support from the teaching team of the Masters of Data Science at the University of British Columbia.

## About

Everyone is encouraged to ask questions and initiate discussions about these guidelines.

It is also noted that this Code is not exhaustive or complete. It is not a rulebook; it serves to distil our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.
